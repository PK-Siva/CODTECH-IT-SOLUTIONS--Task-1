OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

Project: DATA PROCESSING Data Preprocessing Pipeline for Machine Learning

This project provides a step-by-step guide to preprocessing raw data for machine learning tasks. It takes a user-uploaded dataset (in CSV format), performs essential data cleaning and transformation tasks, and prepares the data for use in machine learning models.

The preprocessing pipeline includes:

Handling Missing Data: Imputing missing values for both numerical and categorical columns. Encoding Categorical Variables: One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical features into numerical form. Feature Scaling: Standardizing numerical features to bring them to a common scale. Data Splitting: Dividing the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation. This project is designed to be used in Google Colab, making it easy for users to upload their own datasets and apply preprocessing in a cloud environment.

Features Automatic Upload and Processing: Users can upload their dataset through a simple UI, and the pipeline will automatically process the data. Imputation of Missing Values: Missing values in numerical columns are replaced with the mean, while missing categorical values are imputed with the most frequent category. One-Hot Encoding: Categorical variables are transformed into numerical features using One-Hot Encoding. Feature Scaling: Numerical features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Train-Test Split: The data is split into training and testing sets to prepare for machine learning model training and evaluation. Steps Upload Dataset: Upload your dataset in .csv format through Google Colab. Load and Explore Data: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The first few rows are displayed for a quick overview of the data. Handle Missing Values: Numerical columns: Missing values are imputed using the mean of the column. Categorical columns: Missing values are imputed using the most frequent category (mode). One-Hot Encoding: Categorical variables are transformed using One-Hot Encoding, which creates binary columns for each category. Feature Scaling: Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to standardize their distribution. Split Data: The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), and further divided into training and test sets (80%-20%). Tools and Libraries Used Pandas: For loading and handling the dataset. Scikit-learn: For data imputation, One-Hot Encoding, scaling features, and splitting data into training and testing sets. Google Colab: For providing an easy-to-use interface for uploading datasets and running the preprocessing pipeline in the cloud. Getting Started To use this project, follow the steps below:

Upload Dataset: Click on the "Upload" button to upload your CSV file containing the dataset. Run the Code: After uploading the file, the code will automatically perform data cleaning, imputation, encoding, scaling, and splitting. Check Results: View the processed data and the shapes of the resulting training and test sets. Example Use Case This pipeline is suitable for preprocessing datasets in a wide range of machine learning tasks, such as:

Supervised Learning: Classification and regression tasks where labeled data is available. Feature Engineering: Preparing data for use with various machine learning models like decision trees, logistic regression, or neural networks. Data Exploration: Quickly cleaning and transforming datasets for exploratory data analysis (EDA). How to Contribute If you would like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. Contributions can include:

Adding more preprocessing steps (e.g., handling outliers, feature selection). Improving the pipeline to handle edge cases or additional data formats. Enhancing documentation or adding new features.

Example Output After processing, the following outputs are expected:
